    <h2>Menu Description:</h2>
    <p>Martabak are savory light bites that originated from a Middle-Eastern recipe of the same name. It is basically a spicy omelet pancake stuffed with bits of vegetables and minced meat and can be bought from almost any street vendor in Indonesia after sunset. Palembang, with Martabak HAR, and Aceh, with Martabak Aceh, are two of the few regions in Indonesia that have given their own twist to Martabak. There is also another general variant of Martabak called Martabak Manis (other regions, such as Malang, call it ‘Kue Terang Bulan’), which is basically a large pancake stuffed with toppings like chocolate, cheese, and peanuts. It might look complicated, but it’s actually very easy to make and the ingredients are available at many shops near you.</p>
