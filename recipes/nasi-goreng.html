    <h2>Menu Description:</h2>
    <p>A highly-versatile dish, Nasi Goreng (literally translated as ‘fried rice’) is an Indonesian dish that has its
        roots in Southern Chinese culture. It mainly consists of seasoned rice stir-fried with pieces of meat and
        vegetables. This dish originated from people’s concern about ways to use leftover rice. It is not clear exactly
        when the Indonesians adopted the recipe of Chinese fried rice and put their own traditional ‘twist’ on Nasi
        Goreng, but some say it happened around the 10th century, during Sriwijaya’s reign when the trade between
        Indonesia and China flourished. </p>
    <p>Nowadays, almost every region in Indonesia had its own signature recipe of Nasi Goreng (such as Nasi Goreng Jawa,
        Nasi Goreng Aceh, Nasi Goreng Padang, etc.) and you can find it in almost every corner of every street.</p>
