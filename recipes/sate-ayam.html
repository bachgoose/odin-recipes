    <h2>Menu Description:</h2>
    <p>The last traditional dish that is so easy to find in Indonesia is Sate Ayam, a grilled chicken skewer served with
        peanut sauce. It is believed that the word ‘Sate’ originated from Tamil ‘catai’, a regional variant of ‘tacai’
        meaning ‘flesh’, which is the indication that the dish was initially developed by Javanese street vendors as an
        adaptation of Indian kebabs. In West Sumatra, there is a popular variant of Sate Ayam dish called Sate Padang, a
        grilled beef skewer served with a distinctive spicy Minang sauce.</p>
