The First HTML Project

Notes in the beginning of the project:
In this first project from The Odin Project's course, I will try to create a simple web page about food recipes using basic HTML documents and Git. 

The HTML-related skills which I will apply in this project are:
1. Structuring web folders and files;
2. HTML boilerplates;
3. HTML elements and attributes: Texts, images, links, etc;
4. Git and GitHub;
5. Linux command line.
